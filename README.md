<h1 align="left">Hephaestes38</h1>

Hephaestes38 is a custom, 38 key, low profile, split unibody keyboard. I Intended it to be used with the Hands Down promethium layout, but that's really up to you! ZMK studio has also been integrated, so it's super easy to make any changes you wish. See the [writeup](https://github.com/DeppressedCabbage/Hephaestes38-zmk/blob/main/Keymap.md) on Hands Down Promethium and my specific combos/layers. I only use 3 Layers, but the firmware has a total of 5 for you to add any you like.

It's programmed on a Nice!Nano for wireless functonality, as well as compatibility for a Nice!View E-paper display to keep track of layers, battery status, or whatever else suits your fancy.

### PCB's
All files to make your own pcb's can be found in the pcb's and cases folder. The Hepheaestes38_PCB-Gerbers.zip can be uploaded into any pcb manufacturer to get them made, and all of the kicad files are available if you want to make any edits. If you are looking for an assembled PCB, reach out to me at conturakeyboards@gmail.com. A website will be coming soon if you would like to purchase pcb's or fully assembled keyboards. Stay tuned. 

***
### BOM

Additionally, you'll also need the following

- 38x SMD diodes (1N4148W)
- 38x Kailh Choc Hotswap Sockets
- 38x Kailh Choc V1 Switches
- 1x Nice!Nano
- 2× Pair of headers and sockets for the N!N (I used the easy solder machine headers, but mil-max sockets will work just fine too)
- (optional) 1x Nice!View
- (optional) 1x Lipo battery (301230)
- (optional) 1x Power switch (PCM12)
- (optional) 1x Reset switch (PTS526)
- (optional) Rubber feet to stop the keyboard sliding around (I used 3mm by 10mm ones, but if you aren't using a case it shouldn't matter much)

***
### Firmware

Hepheaestes38 runs ZMK, you can modify and compile you're own firmware by cloning the repo and making any edits you like.

### V1 Case

This is the first version of they keyboard, and I forgot to add mounting holes to the pcb to facilitate Case attachement. I worked around this in a less than elegant way, and if you want to make v1 you would have to do something similar. Pictures are below.

### V2 Case

Version 2 of the pcb and case Make some much needed improvements to allow for easier manufacturing, a slightly better fitment in terms of the screen and control board, and most importantly, holes to facilitate Case attachement.

### To Do List

- ✔Create Case
- ✔Add via's to the pcb to facilitate Case attachement
- ✔Refine Pcb to allow for diode attachment on both sides, along with turning Diode Footprint around
- ✖ Lower profile? - Coming Soon in a different project
- ✔ Add zmk Studio support
- ✔ Order V2 pcb's to confirm fitment

### Credits

This is my first foray into making my own keyboard, so special thanks go out to the entire ergo community, notably 

- [FlatFootFox](https://twitter.com/flatfootfox) - for the guide to ergogen
- [Ceoloide](https://github.com/ceoloide) - For the footprints used in creating the pcb
- [Lesshonor](https://github.com/lesshonor) - For helping me out with the getting the display to work
- And my lovely offline support system for moral support and encouragement.
